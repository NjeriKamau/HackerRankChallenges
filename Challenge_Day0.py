#Task
#To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. 
#on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.

#You've got this!

#Note: The instructions are Java-based, but we support submissions in many popular languages. 
#You can switch languages using the drop-down menu above your editor, 
#and the variable may be written differently depending on the best-practice conventions of your submission language

# Read a full line of input from stdin and save it to our dynamically typed variable, input_string.
inputString = raw_input()

# Print a string literal saying "Hello, World." to stdout.
print 'Hello, World.'

# TODO: Write a line of code here that prints the contents of input_string to stdout.
print inputString
